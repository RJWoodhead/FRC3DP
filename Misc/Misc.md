A simple breakout board for the SparkMax data port - the commercially-available one uses pads instead of through-holes, which are difficult to solder. This one has both pads and provision for screw connectors. The [project page at EasyEda](https://oshwlab.com/madoverlord/sparkmax-data-port-breakout-board) has the BOM for the parts, and you can get 10 boards for under $10 including shipping at [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com). For convenience I've [included the gerber files in this repo](Files/Breakout_Gerber_PCB1_2024-01-26.zip). You will need some ribbon cable to connect the breakout board to the SparkMax; the cables are [available on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FW14TCF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1).
